## Events

### Coded Bias movie in Fontys (3.3.2023)

I participated in the event and discussion on 3rd of March in Fontys where we watched and discussed the documentary Coded Bias. It was oriented around **ethics** and

I would say it did make me think about how AI is used. I do definitely agree with the sentiment that AI should not be used for policing and making decisions about law.

However, there were some aspects about it that I did not really agree with. One example is that Amazon's hiring AI that hired mostly men was presented as biased against women. I don't agree that's the case. The AI's end goal was to increase good hires and eventually shareholder value. I don't think the goal of a corporation is to be sexist so it can rather be said that the AI was biased towards people that were more likely to make more money for the company.

One other thing I didn't like is the delivery. The whole documentary was centered around race and sex which are touchy subjects and that only serves to divide people. And if the point of the documentary is to invoke some reaction and eventually legislation/law, focusing on how "White men have it easy" presented to an audience of mostly White men is not the correct way to do it. A good example that the documentary or the teacher gave was an innocent person was arrested because of a mistake the AI make. Then the reaction could be "I am innocent, that could be me". Sadly that was only one example and the rest was politicized and dividing.

When it comes to the relevancy of my development, our group project is AI related. However, we neither know nor make decisions based on people's internal qualities. Our red-teaming AI is going to "fight" the blue-teaming AI of a company. We don't plan on releasing that publicly so the chance of it ending up in the wrong hands is low.

This event also inspired one of my personal project ideas - [evading night vision facial detection cameras](/portfolio-cs7/en/personal/evade-facial-detection).
