## Character Development

I am Lazar Dimitrovski, and I am interested in building a career in cybersecurity sector. I can describe
myself as proactive, curious, and willing-to-learn student who never refuses to learn something new. In
addition, I am a type of person that is enthusiastic to work on practical projects, where many skills and
competencies are needed such as communication, research, leadership.
Before enrolling in the cybersecurity specialization, I was doing media. I changed my academical
trajectory in the fourth semester due to the newly found interest in hacking. Before this I haven’t had
any cybersecurity encounters. 

Coming from media to cybersecurity was and still is a more difficult road
to take but exploring and finding your professional self is a worthy obstacle to overcome.
Additionally, I did a security audit to a cryptocurrency exchange platform in my internship semester in
the company called Boosting Alpha. This experience provided me technical knowledge and prepared me
for formal interactions, data showcase with higher ranking colleagues and shareholders. This work
experience was extremely beneficial personally, where no mistakes were allowed. I am happy that it
brought me know-how, time management and organizational skills that I plan to implement this
semester. I expect this specialization to guide me in broadening my horizons and prepare me for the
professional world. This semester I am aiming to learn additional security techniques, upgrade already
known skills and prepare professionally for the graduation internship.


## Personal goals

end, personal goals in the cybersecurity penetration testing sector should be pursued with a dedication

## Weaknesses

When it comes to weaknesses, I tend to stay in my mind a lot and am a bit insensitive. I am also described as impatient which I certainly don’t agree with. I tend to start a lot of personal projects and not finish them as I keep starting new ones.
