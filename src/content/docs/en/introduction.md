My name is Angel Angelov and I am from Bulgaria.

## Fontys

I am a semester 6 student in Fontys doing the software route with a specialization in cybersecurity and secure development.

## Previous school and interests

I have finished a language high school where I studied French and English. I am interested in all kinds of IT but mostly in web development with a mix of security in it. I enjoy sleeping but don’t get enough of it.

## 16 personalities

I have done the 16personalities test and according to it, I am an INTP-A which stands for Introverted (76%), Intuitive (62%), Thinking (79%), Prospecting (60%) and Assertive (75%), named by the website as Logician.

I am described as analytical, curious, objective and open minded and constantly on the lookout for problems to solve, which I agree with.

## Weaknesses

When it comes to weaknesses, I tend to stay in my mind a lot and am a bit insensitive. I am also described as impatient which I certainly don’t agree with. I tend to start a lot of personal projects and not finish them as I keep starting new ones.
