title: 'Initial Ideas'
---

We started off by brainstorming about diffrent ideas for a project and then narrowing them down by combing or removing what isn't interesting or doable.

## My ideas

- WAF (combined at second stage with anomaly detection idea)
- Phishing campaign generator

## Ranking

Each member had 3 points to give to a project. 2 for his most favorite one and 1 for his second favorite. In the end, all points were combined to make up the ranking inside "Own project" column.

Ranking inside "Company project" was based upon what we believed was the most suitable for the company.

## Decision

In the end, after talking with the client, we agreed upon idea 7 - blue team evasion techniques - although it wasn't initially anyone's favorite.
