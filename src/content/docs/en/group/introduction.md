## Company

ACA-IT is an IT service company located in Eindhoven providing services for a plethora of clients. They distinguish themselves from their competitors by focussing on innovative business-related IT-solutions, continuity, availability and most importantly, security.

## Goal of the project

We are living in the information era, which means data is increasingly valuable. Therefore, the threat of advisories trying to exfiltrate that data, becomes prominent.

Blue teamers are tasked with safeguarding the security, confidentiality, and integrity of a system. As AI (Artificial Intelligence) evolves over the years, it is getting implemented in a lot of different fields, including blue teaming. One example is the usage of anomaly detection in monitoring software to detect irregularities.

On the other side, there are red teamers that try to remain undetected, and what better way than to fight fire with fire. The goal of the project is to research and develop ways red teams can use AI to avoid detection, and in turn use that information to help companies bolster their defenses.

## Scope

1. Writing documentation on how the client can deploy/test the solution

2. The AI is going to function on a test environment (NetLab)

3. Demo environment on NetLab

## Method of work

Scrum, as it offers the most flexibility, which is important for a topic we don't know much about. Each sprint will consist of 3 weeks.

## End products

- Project plan
- Research document(s)
- AI prototype
- Manual
