## Group project

### Sprint 0

- Brainstorming on [ideas for a project](/portfolio-cs7/en/group/ideas). I proposed 2 ideas (WAF and phishing campaign generator) both of which were picked in the top 3 when all group members voted.
- Sharing resources that I found related to the final group project idea we picked - blue team evasion techniques, such as the article [Legislation in Hesse and Hamburg regarding automated data analysis for the prevention of criminal acts is unconstitutional](https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2023/bvg23-018.html)
- Contributing to the [project plan](/portfolio-cs7/project-plan.pdf) and ideas for the project such as studying current anomaly detection techniques and products, testing strategy inside the project plan, and reviewing it, proofreading it and changing parts that could be improved.
- Scheduling meetings

#### Retrospective

Sprint 0 was messy but that was expected. There were issues with project choice in the beginning as the idea was changed the last moment but we organized a meeting with the stakeholder and settled on an idea that most group members agreed on.

## Personal project

### Sprint 0

- Brainstorming for ideas for personal project that are doable in 1 day a week

#### Retrospective

Generally went well.

I couldn't think of many ideas in the beginning and wanted to use my personal project day for a bigger specialization but Martin convinced me otherwise and gave me some inspiring ideas and past projects he has seen on a meeting we had.

- "**_research_**" means:
  - defining a research approach in a structured way with defined research questions, a combination and triangulation of diverse research strategies, and methodical approach to answer research questions with defined strategies (note: add your project research approach here with LO2, but also mention it in your research overview for LO3 with your overall evaluation and reflection).
  - accounting for choices and alternatives during a research or project execution.
  - planning and performing the transfer of r&d outcomes to client, stakeholders, target groups, community and society (note: give transfer activities, planning and products here with LO2, but mention and evaluate the relevant aspects for your collaboration and communication in LO3).
- "**_development_**" means:
  - technical development skills,
  - learning and using new technology or new technological concepts in development
  - project management skills as a developer and innovator towards peers, stakeholders, target groups, experts (note: also mention and evaluate the relevance for LO3 collaboration and communication, and management)
- "**_innovative solutions_**" means that you can explain how your solution contributes in a new way to the problem or wish from stakeholders and target groups. This includes considerations on technical, functional, organizational, societal, sustainable, and ethical aspects.
