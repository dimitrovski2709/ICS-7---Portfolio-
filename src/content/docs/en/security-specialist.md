title: 'LO1 Security Specialist'
---

I will be specializing in **secure development** as I think that is an important part of software development that is often missed.

I would like to learn more about authentication as well as to learn more about encryption, specifically client side encryption. I plan on doing that through my [secure file storage specialization project](/portfolio-cs7/en/specialization/introduction)

## Work (in progress)

- [How to ensure files are only accessible by allowed parties](/portfolio-cs7/en/specialization/confidentiality)
- [How to ensure files are always available](/portfolio-cs7/en/specialization/availability)
- [What are the possible ways to improve endpoint security from inside the limited access of a browser](/portfolio-cs7/en/specialization/endpoint)
- [Design](/portfolio-cs7/en/specialization/design)

## Evaluation and reflection
